                  <br>Humanity is set to face a rare convergence of three massive cycles of change. In this inaugural episode, best-selling author Gregg Braden guides us through the cyclic evidence, which charts the simultaneous peaking of economic and, human conflict, and solar system cycles. The rise and fall in each of these cycles holds major implications for our civilization and earth. As all three cycles are beginning to peak, a new story about humanity emerges. For us to understand how this story will unfold, we must first take an honest look at who we really are and where we came from. From the time of our ancestors to modern man, there are deep truths that returning patterns reveal. Braden’s work involves the idea of fractal patterns, which he developed writing Fractal Time: The Secret of 2012 and a New World Age.<br>

This involved the strategic use of magnetism, sacred geometry, even potentized water. But what science is now discovering is that these unique places also retain a lasting energetic fingerprint that is capable of transferring vital, living codes to the people who interact with them.Although we stopped building temples long ago, in a bizarre twist, the same effect has been discovered inside genuine crop circles. What’s more, both crop circles and sacred sites are capable of transmitting a healing code to people, even when they are far away from each other — a concept known as radionics.Bestselling author and researcher Freddy Silva takes you through an extraordinary series of connections, and shares his discovery of combining crop circles symbols with resonance therapy to create a practical system of remote healing. Prepare to discover an ancient art and a radical, practical spiritual technology.</p>

            <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-2"> Does the sun have the power to transform humankind? In Solar Revolution, world-renowned German biophysicist Dieter Broers makes a compelling case, pointing to a wealth of scientific evidence that shows a remarkable correlation between increases in solar activity and advances in our creative, mental and spiritual abilities.We are in the midst of a dramatic rise in solar disturbances, which have the capability of disrupting the Earth’s geomagnetic field and, as a result, our global ecology. Broers, however, sees this not as an impending apocalypse but as the dawn of a new era. Drawing on research from a variety of disciplines, he shows how erupting solar activity carries the potential to boost our brain capacity and expand our minds in ways we never imagined possible. Spiritual abilities now seen as extraordinary or supernatural—telepathy, extrasensory perception, and off-the-charts intelligence quotients—may soon become ordinary and natural and could very well help us solve the mounting global crises we are facing.Without a doubt, the way we think, feel, relate, communicate, and experience reality has been changing dramatically in recent years, and Dieter Broers assertsffirms those changes will ultimately culminate in a new form of consciousness and harmony on Earth. Humankind is going through an evolutionary leap, says Broers, and the process has already begun.</p>

We must learn to live cooperatively, rather than competitively.You don’t have to do it all at once — if you work on even just 1% improvement every day, you will begin to change the thought process.

                  <br>From an early age, Uri Geller knew that he was different. As a young child, he witnessed an energetic phenomenon that would change him forever. Soon after, he found out that he was able to bend spoons, read minds, and move objects without touching them. All of which eventually caught the attention of the military. We follow along with tales of his childhood, where he discovered his unusual gifts, through the events that shaped his motivation and inspiration for living a phenomenal life that would change the world’s understanding of how powerful our minds really are. He shares with us his unique perspective of the way our minds can willfully affect the molecular structure of objects causing them to change shape or manifest.<br>

                  <br>Before there was an official remote viewing program, there was Uri Geller. In 1972, he traveled to Stanford Research Institute to have his unusual abilities tested under laboratory conditions. Unbeknownst to him, many of these scientists had direct links to the CIA which had a strong interest in his ability to gather information that they could not get in any other way. During this time, he worked with prominent scientists, such as Edgar Mitchell, Russell Targ, and Ingo Swan, who would go on to establish the initial Remote Viewing project. Much of what they did is still secret, but we gain access to footage from these experiments and see, first hand, the astounding results that shaped the CIA’s belief in the paranormal.<br>

                  <br>Some question whether or not we have angels surrounding us, guiding and protecting us. For Uri Geller, there is no doubt that they are real. Many events, from his extraordinary life, have definitively proven to him the reality of life after death and the paranormal. He shares stories of how he instantly traveled across NY state, his encounters with birds as souls visiting loved ones, and we see the egg given to John Lennon by an extraterrestrial being.<br>

                  <br>Dowsing for oil may have been one of Uri Geller’s most lucrative endeavors, but it did nothing for him, spiritually. As a child, he learned how to find lost objects using only his hands, guided by intuition. He was able to capitalize on this ability, as several oil mineral companies used him to find rich deposits. One of his greatest treasures, that he shares with us, is a crystal skull found in the Temple of Inscriptions, given to him by the president of Mexico. But, when he discovered the spiritual nature of his abilities, all of these material gains paled in comparison to living a life of greater spiritual fulfillment.<br>
