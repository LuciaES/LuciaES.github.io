      <h2>Eilis</h2>
      <p>I highly recommend an akashic reading with Lucia. The experience gave me clear insights into my soul purpose and a strong sense of direction in my career and relationships. Lucia was so kind and heartfelt - she explained the process step-by-step and took time to answer all my questions. The predictions made were completely accurate and I found the reading very reassuring in my daily life. I cannot wait for the next one! Thank you Lucia for sharing your amazing gift!<br>~ Eilis</p>

    <div>
      <h2>Marina</h2>
      <p>I know they are there and I know we can connect with them, a higher world and a higher self and that's why I chose to look for someone who can contact that world. It was not easy to find, because of my skeptical self but I still found Lucia, to confirm what I already knew but did not dare to trust what I felt .... Thank you nicely Lucia.... Good blesse you.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Ana</h2>
      <p>I was a bit hesitant at first and had so many friends that recommended it, it took me a couple of years but it had to be when I was ready to listen. Lucia is great and takes her time to explain the records and guides you through the process. I highly recommend it, sometimes you need help in hearing what your soul and angels wants to tell you and this is the way. I found I learned more about myself with the reading...</p>

      <h2>Julio</h2>
      <p>I highly recommend her readings, they help clear the way to one's true path in life, to help in becoming the best version of ourselves, to know oneself and to grow.</p>
      <div>
      <h2>Aurelie</h2>
    <p>My readings with Lucia were better than I could have ever hoped. The first time we met I felt like I was speaking to a very old friend or close cousin. There has not been a day that has gone by that something she mentioned in the reading runs through my mind as a reminder or piece of advice for all of the big decisions I have been making right now. Forever grateful.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
      <h2>Gyongyver</h2>
      <p>A reading with Lucia changed my life in 1 hour, ok maybe in 2. It sounds like a cliche, but for me, it really happened. I had been struggling my whole adult life understanding why things happened to me and it was impossible for me to let go of the past. Through Her, the masters and spirit guides told me what I needed to hear. Within seconds everything made sense and I walked out from the reading like a new person. We also talked about the possible futures, what's written in my Book; which thinking back now, I kind of knew all along but I was listening to the wrong voices. I am forever thankful for Her guiding me into a new happier life. GCB</p>

      <h2>Ramona</h2>
      <p>I heard about Lucia about 4 years ago . The first time we met, I did not know what to expect and I certainly did not expect to meet someone who was confirming my every thought. Everything that she described fully resonated with me, whether is was about one of my family members or the life path I was on, at the time. While she was talking to me, I felt like a cloud of fog was lifting up and my thoughts wear clear and it was a confirmation of what I knew, but one that I needed so much. It was like one was reading my own thoughts, thoughts that I never dared to express. Over the years, we have had more sessions and I look forward for the next one , always. Lucia is very comforting to be around and it is very easy to communicate with her. She was a stranger when I first met her, yet I never felt that , for her presence is comforting and during the session with her , one feels very relaxed and nothing seems forced. If you have questions about your path in life, if you are wondering already if talking to Lucia is the right thing for you, then you know the answer already. Lucia is fantastic and I am happy to have met her and to be able to connect with the higher spirits through her help. Thank you, Lucia!</p>

      <h2>Roxana</h2>
<p>I heard about Lucia from a friend.I was nor happy nor unhappy,I was just floating with no purpose and a sense of wanting something else..not to mention a very vague frustration..tho I have to mention I was living at that time on a beautiful island.
After my meeting with Lucia,I came out lighter like I dropped a heavy weight off my shoulders.Everything had changed.I got my sparkle back and SUDDENLY everything was making sense again.The puzzle that I call life was starting to get a shape and so it began my first conscious step of my quest in finding and fulfilling my purpose.I left my job after few months,left the island and decided to take a sabatical year.(all this made sense and was so much easier to do after my meeting with Lucia).Once I stepped on my path I felt happier and I realized leaving was the best thing I could have ever done for my life at that time .I have contacted Lucia,two more times after that and every time,to get guidance and reassurance I was doing things right.Now again I'm on the brink of another step in my path to my destiny and I can say I trust things will fall into place because I'm not only listening to what Lucia had to comunicate from my masters to me, but also to my intuition.She has influenced in good many ppl lives and even tho in the begining I was definetely sceptical about all that she was supposed to be able to do , I came out not only convinced about the reality of what she is doing but also so much more open to everything good that the universe has to offer for me.When we really need help someone or something will appear to guide us,nudge us in the right direction.After that is all up to us.Lucia is a really sweet caring person that does things from her heart and it shows. She takes her time to really explain when things are not clear and she will answer as many questions as she can.</p></div>

    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My path towards a more spiritual life was not easy but much need, like many other out there.<br>11 years ago I found myself having repetitive dream preomonitions, mostly of world aviation accidents which I would later see become true on the news. These dreams created many moments of fatigue, depression and anxiety. I would wake up feeling like I had run a marathon and deeply hoping to myself that this one dream wouldn't come true. Most of the times I would see the dream materialize a week later, this meant a week of avoiding the news and trying not to hear what was going on in the world. Some how (nothing is a coincidence), I always found out.I was at the time a private pilot student and achieved my private pilot license, so hearing about aviation accidents between class mates was a common occurrence.<br>The premonition that changed it all was one of great emotional impact for me. I remember seeing passengers screaming crying and panicking. It was the first time I saw faces in a premonition. This impacted me greatly and all I knew is my emotional state could not take it anymore. I had to end what I considered my own hell.<br>The Akashic Records was my blessing! I attended my very first Akashic Records reading with two questions written down in bold: Why do I keep having these dreams? and How can I get rid of them? I went into that reading believing I would be given an earth bound solution to my spiritual predicament. What I got in response was more profound, become aware that you can use your mind for something else other than thinking. The quickest solution being; learn to read your own Akashic Records.<br>That is how I became an Akashic Records reader. I began my first ever spiritual journey into this new amazing world.<br>After learning to read my own records, I wanted to help others, just like I had been helped and so 8 years ago I began reading others.<br>I get to feel amazing every time I assist someone in a reading and best of all, no more accident dream premonitions!</p>
